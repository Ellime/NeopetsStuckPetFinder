# NeopetsStuckPetFinder
A tool that finds Neopets in the Pound. Written in Java SE 8 and uses jsoup. Documentation only!

This is a program written to be used on Neopets.com, a virtual pet game site.

This program searches up names directly in the Pound. The names are generated by the program based on your specifications. The motivation is to find stuck pets.
